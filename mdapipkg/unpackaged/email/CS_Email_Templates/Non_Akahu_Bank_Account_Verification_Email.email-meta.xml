Here is what we need to manually verify your bank account:

This needs to show your first name, last name (as they appear on your ID), current address, and bank account number.

From the same account, make a $1 deposit.
Using the details below. This is a one time verification that is automatically refunded back to you.

Follow these steps to make a $1 deposit:

Go to your online bank
2.
Select to make a payment

Bank verification is a necessary process to ensure your details are correct. It’s worth knowing that we’ll only keep a record of the info we need to verify your bank account.

Please let us know if you have any further questions and we&apos;ll help you get started with Tempo!

Thank you,
{!User.FirstName}
